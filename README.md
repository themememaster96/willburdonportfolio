Iris Clustering


Description: 

This project applies the KMeans clustering algorithm to one of the most popular machine learning datasets: the Iris dataset. The project includes preprocessing the data, performing clustering, and comparing the clustering results with the actual labels through visualizations and a classification report.

Forest Fires

Description:
The following project will use the linear regression model to predict the "FFMC" attribute in the Forest-fires dataset. The model will be trained on the following features within the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset: "DMC", "DC", "ISI", "temp", "wind", and "area". The project will consist of pre-processing the data, training and testing of the model, and visualizations.

Linear Regression (KNN Model)


Description:
In this project, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is utilized to predict car evaluation class, depending on buying cost, maintenance fees, and safety factors. The model is trained on labelled data and its performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy.
